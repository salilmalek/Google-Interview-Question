# Google Interview Question

USING JAVA You are given an integer X. You must choose two adjacent digits and replace them with a single adigit that equals to the rounded up average of these two digits.

For example, from the integer X= 623315, you can obtain:

43315(by replacing 62with 4);

63315(byreplacing 23 with 3, since the average of 2 and3is 2.5 that is rounded up to 3);

62315(by replacing 31 with 2);

62333(by replacing 15 with 3)

You want to find the largest nmber that can be obtained from X by replacing two adjacent digits with the rounded- up average of the two. In the above example, the largest such number is 63315

Write a function:

class Solution{ public int solution( int X);}

that, given a positive integer X, returns the largest number that can be obtained from x by replacing two adjacent igits with the roundedup average of the two.

For example, given x = 623315, the function shoul dreturn 63315 as the explained above.

Assume that X is an integer withing the range of [10.. 1,000,000,000]
